What I'm up to:
- Exploring free and open source software, specifically Darktable and GIMP for photo editing
- Making custom seat cushions for outdoor benches (this has been much harder than I thought...)
- Working as a Data Analyst

This is my [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, inspired by Derek Sivers.
