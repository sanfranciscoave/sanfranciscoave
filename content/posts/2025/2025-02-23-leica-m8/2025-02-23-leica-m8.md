*Painting* is not the word most people would use to describe the action of using a camera to end up with a picture. *Shooting*, *capturing*, or *taking* is the more common phrase here. And yet...I hear the phrase "let me paint you a picture" all the time. So I guess you can "paint" a picture with words or watercolor, but not a camera? 

I've been thinking about this because in the right conditions - it really feels like you can paint a picture the M8. *Paintings* with beautiful colors and just the right balance of sharpness and softness.

That's not to say all photos from the M8 turn out great...this camera really *paints* in colorful environments on bright sunny days. In anything else, I'd say it *shoots* okay, not bad or anything, but not *painting*.

some *Paintings* from this month:
