*Painting* is not the verb most people would use to describe using a camera. *Shooting* is the right word to be using. And yet, here I am, paiting...

I say that becuase in the right conditions - it really feels like you can make paintings with this camera. Paintings with vibrant colors and tones. Paintings with beautiful glow and softness. All with minimal editing (the photos below just required a bit of brilliance and chroma). 

That's not to say all photos from the M8 turn out great...this camera really *paints* in colorful environments on bright sunny days. In anything else, I'd say it *shoots* okay, not bad or anything, but not *painting*.

some *paintings* from this month:
