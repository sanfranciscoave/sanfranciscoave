*Painting* is not the word most people would use to describe the action of using a camera to end up with a picture. *Shooting*, *capturing*, or *taking* is the more common phrase here. And yet...I hear the phrase "let me paint you a picture" all the time. So I guess you can "paint" a picture with words or watercolor, but not a camera?

A photograph in the traditional sense is a snapshot of reality. When you see a photo of someone online, there’s an expectation they look similar when you meet them in person.

But what happens when you capture a long exposure? Reality is distorted into a blur of light and shape...is that still capturing reality? Or is that painting with light?

There comes a point where I think reality start to turn into a painting of sorts. When you deliberately introduce streaks and blurs to an image. Or even double expose a frame.
