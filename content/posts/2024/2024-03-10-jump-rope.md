I've heard lots of people say you need 4 kinds of hobbies, usually falling into some variation of these categories:

- Physical
- Intellectual
- Creative
- Social

All throughout high school and college, I use to skate. That was my physical hobby that kept me in shape for the most part, although I didn't think of it that way, I did it because it was fun.

There's also all the emotions of fear, struggle, perseverance, and triumph that come with learning a new trick. I think that's what made it so much fun for me, it never felt boring.

Now, I just don't get those same kinds of emotions during a run or a bike ride.

I think jump rope might just do it for me. Theres all kinds of people doing crazy tricks on the Internet, and it just feels fun trying to learn, just like skating did.

I've been jumping rope a couple of times per week now.

Thanks for reading.
