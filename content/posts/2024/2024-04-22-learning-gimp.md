GIMP is a free open source alternative to photoshop and so far, I'm really liking it. Prior to this, I tried using darkroom, a free open source alternative to lightroom, but I'm not a fan of tool selection interface. Maybe I'm just not using it right, but I find it super confusing to navigate. GIMP seems to have a much cleaner interface and navigating all the tools thus far has been super easy for me.

The first image I processed using GIMP, taken on my Pentax Q7.
