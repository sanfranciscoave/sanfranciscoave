I like the idea of having tool kits for everything.

A tool kit for your car, a tool kit for your bike, a tool kit for your home, you get the idea.

Below are the tools that live on my desk, my "desk took kit" of sorts. I keep most of them in a glass mason jar on the left side of my desk, next to my lamp. I would say each item falls into 1 of 3 categories:

## 1. Writing Instruments

  - **Fountain pen**
    * Kaweco Sport for when I'm feeling fancy. Specifically, signing checks with this pen just hits different. I hope to one day pick up the brass version.
  - **Ball point pen**
    * Parker Jotter for everything else, it's a good pen, I love the *click* on this one.
  - **Mechanical pencil**
    * Pentel Graphgear 1000, I've had this particular one ever since I took a drafting class in College.
  - **Wood pencil**
    * Sometimes, you gotta go old school.
  - **Eraser**
    * We all make mistakes...
  - **Sharpie**
    * Mostly for labeling stuff.

## 2. Measuring & Calculation Instruments

  - **Calculator**
    * I find it much easier to just pull this thing out rather than pulling out my phone and digging through my app library just to find the calculator.
  - **Rulers**
    * I like having 2 of these, 1 steel ruler for cutting along side with a knife and 1 wooden ruler for everything else.
  - **Calipers**
    * I like these plastic calipers for my desk, I don't have a need to measure tight tolerances here and it's nice not having to worry about scratching the thing I'm measuring.

## 3. Cutting & Opening Instruments

  - **Small phillips and flathead screwdrivers**
    * Usually for opening laptops or other small electronics. I like these from Klein, color coded and the tops spin freely.
  - **Watch case back opener**
    * Opening watch case backs and prying other various things open.
  - **Folding knife**
    * Opinel #7, I believe this is the smallest knife they make with the locking collar.
  - **Scissors**
    * Fiskars orange scissors, great pair of scissors.
