      <description>A while ago, I was browsing Classic Camera Database, and stumbled upon the Panasonic DMC-LC1. The range finder style of the camera immediately caught my attention. So naturally, I scoured Ebay for a couple of weeks and managed to get my hands on one at a pretty good price.&#xA;Picture of LC1 here&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s really a beautiful camera and feels great in the hands. Yes, compared to most modern cameras, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit bulky, but I think that&amp;rsquo;s part of what makes it feel so special.</description>

      <description>Some photos from my trip to the desert, all shot on the Ricoh GR (original 2013 model).&#xA;Quite the magical place if you ask me&amp;hellip;&#xA;Thanks for reading.</description>

      <description>GIMP is a free open source alternative to photoshop and so far, I&amp;rsquo;m really liking it. Prior to this, I tried using darkroom, a free open source alternative to lightroom, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of tool selection interface. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just not using it right, but I find it super confusing to navigate. GIMP seems to have a much cleaner interface and navigating all the tools thus far has been super easy for me.</description>

      <description>I got to watch the solar eclipse yesterday and managed to capture a nice photo. I&amp;rsquo;m living in California, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t see much in terms of darkness, but the outline of the moon was certainly there.&#xA;To get the exposure right, I had to stack all the ND filters I own in front of my camera lens, eight in total. I held the mismatched stack of filters with my left hand while trying to hold my camera steady in my right.</description>
