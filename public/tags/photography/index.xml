      <description>GIMP is a free open source alternative to photoshop and so far, I&amp;rsquo;m really liking it. Prior to this, I tried using darkroom, a free open source alternative to lightroom, but I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of tool selection interface. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m just not using it right, but I find it super confusing to navigate. GIMP seems to have a much cleaner interface and navigating all the tools thus far has been super easy for me.</description>

      <description>I got to watch the solar eclipse yesterday and managed to capture a nice photo. I&amp;rsquo;m living in California, so we didn&amp;rsquo;t see much in terms of darkness, but the outline of the moon was certainly there.&#xA;To get the exposure right, I had to stack all the ND filters I own in front of my camera lens, 8 in total. I held the mismatched stack of filters with my left hand while trying to hold my camera steady in my right.</description>
