			<p>A while ago, I was browsing <a href="www.classiccameradatabase.com">Classic Camera Database</a>, and stumbled upon the Panasonic DMC-LC1. The range finder style of the camera immediately caught my attention. So naturally, I scoured Ebay for a couple of weeks and managed to get my hands on one at a pretty good price.</p>
<p><em>Picture of LC1 here</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really a beautiful camera and feels great in the hands. Yes, compared to most modern cameras, it&rsquo;s a bit bulky, but I think that&rsquo;s part of what makes it feel so special. The body has a real weight to it and the materials feel premium.</p>
<p>The lens on the LC1 is amazing. For those who don&rsquo;t know, the LC1 was a collaborative effort between Leica and Panasonic, and it really shows in the lens. The focal length, focus, and aperture are all controlled by three rings on the lens itself. Each ring feels smooth and robust, with clear wite and yellow markings written in Leica font. Both the aperture and focus rings also have lock buttons when set to auto.</p>
<p>Along with  the shutter speed dial on the top of the camera, you have all the most common controls right at your fingertips. Overall, I&rsquo;d say the LC1 is a great design with regards to controls.</p>
<p>Personally, I think there&rsquo;s really only one challenge when shooting with this camera: speed. Being from 2004, I&rsquo;ll just say focusing and buffering takes a bit of time, so if shooting fast moving action is a priority, the LC1 is probably not a good choice.</p>
<p>The night time performance of this camera is pretty poor also, but I think that&rsquo;s par for the course with these older cameras. The fun part about the LC1 is that it does come with a built in flash. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of fun with that in situations where the light is less than ideal.</p>
<p>Overall, It&rsquo;s a fun camera. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be selling this one any time soon.</p>
<p>Here are some of my favorite photos I&rsquo;ve taken with the LC1.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
