I got to watch to solar eclipse yesterday and managed to capture a nice photo.

To get the exposure right, I had to stack all the ND filters I own in front of my camera lens, 8 in total. I held the mismatched stack of filters with my left hand while trying to hold my camera steady in my right.

Taken on my Pentax Q7.
